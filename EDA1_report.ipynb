    "## 1. Distribution of Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most features (such as AC, FM, UC, DL, DS, DP) have very small values with very low variance, suggesting they might not be contributing much to explaining variance in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "LB and features like ALTV, ASTV, MSTV, Width, and Tendency show a larger spread, indicating these might contain more valuable information or be more impactful when analyzing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Several features have extreme values (e.g., ASTV, MSTV, ALTV), such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "ASTV: Values range from -63.0 to 162.0, with outliers clearly present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Width: Extreme values as well, with a minimum of -174.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features might benefit from further outlier treatment or analysis to improve predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Correlation Insights:\n",
    "Target Variable (NSP):\n",
    "\n",
    "Strongest Positive Correlations:\n",
    "\n",
    "ASTV (+0.44), ALTV (+0.38), and DP (+0.32) are strongly positively correlated with NSP, suggesting they might be important features for predicting NSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strongest Negative Correlations:\n",
    "\n",
    "AC (-0.33) and UC (-0.19) are negatively correlated with NSP. This implies that as these features increase, NSP tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "ASTV has moderate to strong correlations with Width (+0.43) and MSTV (-0.29). This suggests that temporal measurements and width are somewhat related in their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "DL and MSTV are strongly correlated (+0.41), indicating a potential relationship between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Feature Importance (Based on Correlation):\n",
    "The features that appear to hold the most potential for predictive power, based on correlation with NSP, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "ASTV (Autocorrelation in Time Variant): Most highly correlated with NSP, suggesting it might be a key predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTV (Autocorrelation Level Trend Variant): Also shows strong positive correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "DP (Derivative Power): With a correlation of +0.32, it also appears relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "AC and UC: Though they have negative correlations, these might still be worth analyzing further depending on the problem context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on correlation, it seems that ASTV, ALTV, DP, Width, and MSTV might be key features to keep in a model for predicting NSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can drop weakly correlated features (e.g., FM, DS, UC) if they donâ€™t contribute much to variance explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train a Classification Model (since NSP is categorical):\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest to predict NSP with other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
